# TinyURL by Jacob Maarse

## Getting Started

Upon cloning this respository simply change your directory to the project file 'dealTapAssignment' and run the express_server.js file in node. Since the data base is coded into the js file cookies/cached browser data may need to be clear if the program is restarted. In order to see a full commit/version history navigate one folder up in the repository ('week2') as this folders name was changed mid project to something more appropriate/descriptive.

### Getting Started

```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```
